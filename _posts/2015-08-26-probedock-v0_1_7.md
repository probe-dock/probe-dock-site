**Probe Dock v0.1.7** is now available!
This version brings you two new features:

* As an organization admin, you can create [technical users](#technical-users) for continuous integration environments.
* As a new user, you can [register an account and create an organization](#user-registration) to try Probe Dock.

We've also done a lot of work to support new test frameworks, bringing you the following:

* [New Jasmine (with Grunt.js) probe](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-grunt-jasmine)
* [New Karma probe](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-karma)
* [New Java ITF probe](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-itf)

New [probe development libraries](#probe-libraries) are available to develop probes for Node.js and Ruby, as well as Grunt.js plugins.

Also check out the other [improvements & bug fixes](#improvements-fixes) we've made.

## Technical users

When publishing test results to Probe Dock from a continuous integration environment,
integration managers do not want to use their personal Probe Dock credentials to authenticate,
as that would link all tests run from that environment to their user.
A *technical* user is needed, which is not a human user but is authorized to publish test results.

When adding a new member to your organization in Probe Dock,
you can now choose whether to add a standard user or a technical user:

![Technical user form](/media/probedock-v0_1_7/technical-user-form.png)

Your technical users will be listed in the Members page of your organization.
A button in each technical user's box allows you to easily generate an authentication token for that user:

## User registration

Anyone can now register to try out Probe Dock!
The new Register button is available in the menu bar when not logged in:

This feature can be enabled or disabled by the admin of each Probe Dock server by accessing the Settings page in the Admin menu:

## Other improvements & bug fixes

* Registration and invite e-mails are sent asynchronously to avoid long loading times when registering or inviting a new member.
* **BUGFIX:** fixed the uniqueness validation of project names which now correctly allows duplicate project names as long as they are in different organizations.
* **BUGFIX:** fixed the pagination controls of the users table that were not showing (visible only to Probe Dock admins).
