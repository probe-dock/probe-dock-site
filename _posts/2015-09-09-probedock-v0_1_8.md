## Dashboard

The latest reports widget has been renamed to *Recent Activity* and gives much more information about test runs.
In addition to the runner, time and health bar, it now also shows the **project(s)** and **categories** of the tests that were run.

The new tests graph can now be **filtered by project and/or user**, so you can now which projects have the most tests or who are the most active contributors.

## Report details

With the new report filters, you can display only the results you are interested in:

You can filter by **category, tags or tickets**.
Or you can select tests with a name that matches your **search**.
Finally, toggle buttons allow you to show/hide **passed results, failed results, inactive results, results from existing tests and results of new tests** (tests that were first seen in this test run).

*(Note that for now, the doughnut chart indicating the overall status of the test run is not affected by applied filters.)*

Additionally, the categories of the tests that were run are also shown next to the project(s) under the title:

## Projects list

Each project box in the project list now shows a pie chart indicating the **overall status of the last test run** for that project:

## Reports table

The following improvements have been made to the reports table:

* The *Runner(s)* column is now left-aligned.
* Milliseconds are no longer displayed for durations longer than a minute.
* The *Projects* column has become the *Details* column and also indicates the **categories** of the tests that were run.
