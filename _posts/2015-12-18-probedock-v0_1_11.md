## Report Permalinks

It is now possible to build web links to an automated test run report from a continuous integration environment, such as a nightly build.
You can send these links in an e-mail to your developers so that they may more easily access the latest reports.

For now, this feature is limited.
There are two requirements to be able to build a link to a report:

1. You must get the ID of your organization, which you can find in the edition dialog (you must be an organization administrator).

   ![Getting your organization ID]({{ page.media_folder }}/report-permalinks-org-id.jpg)
2. You must submit your test result payloads with an explicit report identifier (UID).

   You might already be doing this if you are grouping multiple test runs (e.g. from different test frameworks) under one report.
   Basically, you must generate a unique identifier for the report before you run the tests, and set the `$PROBEDOCK_TEST_REPORT_UID` environment variable
   [as described here](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-probes#test-run-report-configuration).

Once you have this information, you can build a link that will redirect you to the report once it has been generated.
The format of the link is as follows:

    https://demo.probedock.io/go/report?organizationId=ORG_ID&uid=UID

For example, one of the latest Probe Dock reports testing this feature has the UID `20151218131619-04ed9e53-4eab-421a-9895-0691cb049ba8`, and the Probe Dock organization ID is `6bhni`. The full permalink to that report is therefore:

[https://demo.probedock.io/go/report?organizationId=6bhni&uid=20151218131619-04ed9e53-4eab-421a-9895-0691cb049ba8](https://demo.probedock.io/go/report?organizationId=6bhni&uid=20151218131619-04ed9e53-4eab-421a-9895-0691cb049ba8)

Note that it might take a minute for the link to work after you have submitted the test result payloads,
as Probe Dock might still be building the full report.
But once it's ready, it will serve as a permalink, still working even if you rename your organization.

In the future, we will update the Probe Dock API, UI and probes so that they will provide the permalinks, saving you the trouble of building them.

## JUnit Assumptions Support & Ignored Tests

The [JUnit Probe](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-junit) has been updated to support [assumption failures](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Assumptions-with-assume) and ignored tests.
Both will be sent to Probe Dock but flagged as inactive (shown in yellow).

The [JUnit RT Probe](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-rt-junit) has also been updated to support these features.
These two events prevent the results from being sent to Probe Dock RT.
But they can be sent when filtering is enabled depending on the testing framework used (e.g. Arquillian).

## Probe Dock RT Arquillian Extension

A [Probe Dock RT Arquillian Extension](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-rt-junit) is available to enable test execution filtering.
You do not have to use it for your Arquillian tests but it is required if you want to filter test execution.

Check out the [Arquillian integration demo](https://github.com/probedock/probedock-demo-arquillian).



<a name="java-category-by-package"></a>

## Java Probes Category by Package

Java-based probes have a new feature that allows you to change the Probe Dock category of your tests depending on which package they are in.
This is done through configuration in your `probedock.yml` file.
For example:

    java:
      categoriesByPackage:
        io.probedock.integration.*: Integration
        io.probedock.api**: API

The pattern matching is based on minimatch.



<a name="bugfixes"></a>

## Bugfixes

* Fixed the shell scripts generated by the Getting Started page to be compatible with Bash.
* Fixed a bug where sending a `null` category would cause the test payload processing to fail.
* Fixed a bug where that allowed anonymous users to see private organizations in the list of organizations.



## Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!
