Probe Dock has been selected as the project our team will work on in the [CTI Business Concept course](http://www.cti-entrepreneurship.ch/en/module-en/business-concept/).

For 10 evenings, we will learn to become entrepreneurs. We will have access to numerous resources and [people](http://west.cti-entrepreneurship.ch/en/trainers/) to challenge and develop our business idea.

The Business Concept course is one of four modules offered by the [Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI)](https://www.kti.admin.ch/kti/en/home.html), a Swiss program for technology startups.
