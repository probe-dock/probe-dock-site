The [Jugl](http://jugl/) is a Java user group based in Lausanne, Switzerland. The goal is to facilitate the discussions on the usage and evolution of Java and to establish relations between developers, architects or any kind of people interested by Java technology.

The title of our presentation is: **[Probe Dock - Faites parler vos tests automatis√©s](http://jugl.ch/2016/02/04/ProbeDock.html)**.
