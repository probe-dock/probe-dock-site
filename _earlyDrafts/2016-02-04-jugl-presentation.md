We presented Probe Dock at [JUGL](http://jugl.ch/) this evening.
It went very well and we got interesting questions and feedback.
Thanks to all attendees and of course to organizers and [OCTO](http://octo.ch) for hosting the presentation!

Check out the [slides we used for the presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/21tcoa2xn4ck5h2/Jugl%20February%202016.pdf?dl=0).

As always, do not hesitate to contact us if you have additional questions or feedback.



## Q & A after the presentation

**Does Probe Dock obtain the Jenkins runner when a job is run?**

Not yet. We plan to make a plugin for Jenkins with a deeper integration of Probe Dock.
