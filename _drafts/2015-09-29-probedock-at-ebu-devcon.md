The third [EBU Developer Conference](https://tech.ebu.ch/events/devcon15) will provide an opportunity to learn about best practices in software engineering and get hands-on with current development and deployment tools. Participants will pick up new ideas to run software-driven broadcast infrastructures and to improve their engineering workflows and overall development teams' organisation.

> DevCon 2015 features keynotes from Cornelius Suermann (PayPal), Bob Uva (New Relic) and Ken Schwaber (Scrum.org).

> The conference sessions cover Big Data & Recommendation Systems, Security, Identity Management, DevOps, Distributed Applications, Open Source. Agile Management, Applications for Connected TVs.

> Hands-on Workshops are provided on CPA, D3.js, and Visual Radio and there will be an Agile Clinic, a pitching session and an informal drinks night!

We will present the story behind Probe Dock on October 7! The title of the presentation is: **From nothing to thousands of tests**

And there is the summary: *We worked in a startup where over 6 years the technology team grew from 1 to 25 people, and from nothing we built an automated test suite with thousands of tests. We will tell the story of how we used automated testing as a cornerstone of agile methodologies to increase software quality, and how we solved the main issues we encountered: How do you show the value of automated tests to developers and motivate them to write more? How can you write better tests? How can you have a comprehensive view of software quality across components and technologies?*

We'll give a more precise time when the final conference schedule is published.
The conference will take place at [EBU Headquarters](http://maps.google.ch/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=european+broadcasting+union&sll=46.205393,6.13555&sspn=0.073776,0.167713&ie=UTF8&hq=european+broadcasting+union&hnear=&ll=46.236378,6.135521&spn=0.070766,0.167713&z=13&iwloc=A) in Geneva.
